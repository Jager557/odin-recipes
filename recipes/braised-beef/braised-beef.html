    <h2>How to Braise Beef</h2>
        <p>You'll find the full, step-by-step recipe below — but here's a brief overview of what you can expect when you braise beef at home:</p>
        <ol>
            <li> Season and sear the beef on all sides.</li>
            <li>Cook the vegetables in the drippings and butter. Deglaze with wine.</li>
            <li>Return the meat to the pan with its juices, herbs, and Worcestershire sauce.</li>
            <li>Pour in the beef broth and bring to a simmer.</li>
            <li>Cover and place in the preheated oven until the meat is very tender.</li>
        </ol>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>3 ½ pounds boneless beef chuck roast</li>
            <li>5 teaspoons kosher salt, divided</li>
            <li>2 ½ teaspoons freshly ground black pepper, divided</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons garlic powder</li>
            <li>4 teaspoons olive oil</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
            <li>1 medium onion, chopped</li>
            <li>1 pound cremini mushrooms, halved</li>
            <li>3 medium carrots, cut into 2 inch pieces</li>
            <li>1 head garlic, cut in half lengthwise</li>
            <li>1 cup red wine</li>
            <li>3 sprigs thyme</li>
            <li>2 bay leaves</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons Worcestershire</li>
            <li>2 cups beef broth, or more as needed</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
         <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients and preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
            <img src="../braised-beef/step-1.webp" alt="Every ingredient mentioned above, separated" height="250">
            <li>Season beef pieces evenly on all sides with 3 1/2 teaspoons salt, 2 teaspoons pepper, and garlic powder.</li>

            <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over high heat. Add beef, reduce heat to medium high and cook, undisturbed until it releases easily from the skillet and a golden brown crust has formed, about 4 minutes. Flip pieces and continue to cook until browned on all sides. Remove meat from the pan and set aside.</li>

            <li>Return skillet to medium-high heat and add 2 tablespoons butter to the drippings in the pan. When butter has melted add onion, mushrooms and carrots and cook 5 minutes, stirring often, scraping to release any browned bits from the bottom. Add garlic and cook for 1 minute.</li>

            <li>Stir in wine and scrape to release any more bits from the pan. Return the meat to the pan, along with any accumulated juices and add thyme, bay leaves and Worcestershire.</li>

            <li>Pour in beef broth just enough that it comes up 2/3 of the way up on the beef (do not fully submerge the meat in liquid). Bring the mixture to a simmer.</li>
            <img src="../braised-beef/step-6.webp" alt="All of the ingredients are now partially submerged in broth" height="250">
            <li>Cover and place in preheated oven until meat is very tender, 2 to 2 1/2 hours.</li>
            <img src="../braised-beef/step-7.webp" alt="The braised beef is fully cooked. The meat has become tender and has absorbed the flavors from the broth, garlic, herbs, and vegetables. The beef appears to be falling apart easily, as evidenced by a fork breaking into one of the pieces. The carrots are soft, and the mushrooms, garlic, and thyme are well incorporated into the rich sauce that remains at the bottom of the skillet. The skillet has been placed on a wooden cutting board for serving, giving it a rustic presentation." height="250">
            <li>Serve and enjoy.</li>
